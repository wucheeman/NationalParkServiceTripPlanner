This is an implementation of the XXXXX, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the game
You can use the planner online at GitHub Pages eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
