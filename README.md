#JSON & The VARgonauts

## What the project does
This project explores national parks in the United States. We look at the parks by state, by name, and have a random park selected. We have a sign up sheet for membership.

## How to get started with the game
You can search by a state of your choice. You could also also select a park by a drop down menu. Another choice would be to click on the random park. There is not a required order.

## Authors
This game is being built and will be maintained by the JSON and the VARgonauts team. Team members include Jeannie Rose, Mark Hainline, Anthony Manenti, William Bridges, and Steve Yurchuck.
