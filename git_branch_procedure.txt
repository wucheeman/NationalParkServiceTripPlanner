GIT/GITHUB BRANCH PROCEDURE

Introduction
============
You are working on a project with a team and need to do something to the code like fix a bug or add a feature. To avoid conflicts with changes made by your teammates, you need to branch the code.

You will need to work both on your computer and in GitHub.

In these notes, '$' is the bash command prompt.


Procedure
=========
0. If you like, look at the branches already on your machine with:

	$ git branch
	
1. Create a branch and make it the active branch on your machine with:

	$ git checkout -b <branch name>

If you are doing this from the command line, this will move you into the new branch directory. Open VS Code (either Mac or Windows) with:

	$ code . 
	
In VS Code, look in the lower left corner of the window to verify that you are working on the branch.
	
2. Develop your code, and add and commit as usual. You won't be able to push up to the master repo.

3. When you complete your task, push it up to master/origin at GitHub with:

	$ git push -u origin <branch name>
	
This creates a new branch in master/origin. This now must be merged.

4. Create a pull request via a GUI button that GitHub will pop up. This shows changes, flags conflicts, and enables reviewers to look at files and comment on them.

5. Work with your teammates to resolve conflicts or other issues.

6. Once the merge request is good to go, merge the branch into master/origin via a GitHub GUI button.

7. Delete the branch on GitHub using another GUI button.

8. On your computer, enter:

	$ git checkout master
	
and

	$ git pull

This changes the active branch back to master and pulls down all changes to it -- including those that have just been merged in. 

9. Delete the old, merged-in branch with 

	$ git branch -d <branch name>
	
Check to be sure that it's deleted with 'git branch'.

You're done!
